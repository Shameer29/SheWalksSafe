PDF and Description of the Whole Project is Given
<h1>  Abstract: </h1>
  <h4>According to a 2019 Neta App survey, 42% of Indian women feel ‘unsafe’ in their
surroundings, and 78% feel that authorities are not taking enough measures to ensure the
safety_of_women_in_India.
Safety of Women in India has become a major issue in India now. The crime rates
against women in the country have only risen to a great extent. Women think twice before
stepping out of their homes, especially at the night. This is unfortunately, the sad reality of
our country that lives in constant fear.
To aid in the removal of these constraints, we have introduced a mobile application called
SheWalksSafe (Women's Safety Application) that provides women with a reliable way to
place an emergency dial to the trusted contacts saved in the application, male volunteers
around the surrounding of 2 km and the nearby police station. The Location shares to each
2km distance as the user moves.
 </h4>
 
 <h1> Objective: </h1>
 <h4>SheWalksSafe App is a Women Safety Application. SheWalksSafe is developed for
protecting lives of each and every female citizen in India. In case of any unsafe situation, the
user has to just click the power button more than 4 times and volume up button for
confirmation to enable the SOS. This raises an emergency SOS alert to the trusted contacts
saved in the application, male volunteers around the surrounding of 2 km and the nearby
police station. The SOS alert will be in the form of message informing that the user is unsafe
and the user needs help. The alert message includes accurate current GPS location with
address of the user along with live location of the user. The trusted contacts, male volunteers
and police station can use this live location to get directions and navigate to the exact location
of the distressed person. The app can be used for your personal safety, women safety and
children safety </h4>

<h1>Execution of the application: </h1>
<h4>✓ If the user is a new user, he/she has to sign up initially. Male can sign up as a volunteer
and Female can sign up as a user.<br>

There are 3 modes of support provided for women<br>
1) The user can use help SOS for any kind of small emergency such as accident.<br>

3) In case of any harassment or any abuse the user can click on the power button<br>
more than 4 times and then click on volume up button 1 time to confirm
After clicking on the SOS, the male or female who have logged in as a volunteer, the
trusted contacts saved in the application, and the nearby police station is sent a message
through the application containing name, mobile number, live location and also a picture of
the person who needs help.<br>
And this information is also sent to all of them through email.
If the woman isin the moving state, the live location is shared dynamically to all the volunteers

When they participate in peace processes and other formal decision-making processes, they
can play an important role in initiating and inspiring progress on human rights, justice,
national reconciliation and economic revitalization. So, we believe that the harassment of
